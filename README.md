# Welcome to my Premake Raylib template

This is an easy-to-work-on template to make your own games with Raylib without dealing with setting up anything.
This template includes the core Raylib library but you can include as many dependencies as you want. For that check ``Dependencies.lua``

## Instructions

Once you've cloned, you can customize your project by  ``RaylibGame\premake5.lua``  and ``premake5.lua`` to your liking (eg. chance the name from "RaylibGame" to something else).
Once you're happy, run ``scripts\GenerateProjectVSXXXX.bat`` to generate Visual Studio files.
Enjoy coding!
