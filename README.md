# Welcome to my Premake Raylib template

## Instructions
Once you've cloned, you can customize your project by  ``RaylibGame\premake5.lua``  and ``premake5.lua`` to your liking (eg. chance the name from "RaylibGame" to something else).
Once you're happy, run ``scripts\GenerateProjectVSXXXX.bat`` to generate Visual Studio files.
Enjoy coding!
